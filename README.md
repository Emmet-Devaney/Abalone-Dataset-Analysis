# Abalone-Dataset-Analysis

This repository is an analysis of the Abalone Dataset by Nash ,Warwick, Sellers,Tracy, Talbot,Simon, Cawthorn,Andrew, and Ford,Wes. (1995).

## Libraries

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

# 1.  About This Repository 
...

**The files that this Repository contains:**

* **README.md**
    - A summary and conclusion of the statistical and visual analysis of the Abalone Dataset

* **abalone.csv**
    - This file contains the dataset in question

* **abalone.ipynb**
    - A statistical and visual investigation using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.



# 2. The Dataset

This dataset had been used to predict the age of abalones from physical measurements.

**The Variables:**
-	Sex: Male; Female; and Infant
-	Length: Longest shell measurement in millimetres
-	Diameter: perpendicular to length in millimetres
-	Height: with meat in shell in millimetres
-	Whole Weight: Whole abalone in grams
-	Shucked Weight: weight of meat in grams
-	Viscera Weight: gut weight (after bleeding) in grams
-	Shell Weight: after being dried in grams

# 3. The Analysis of Data

For this project, I will be using pandas to read the dataset and a combination of matplotlib and seaborn to perform a statistical investigation and illustrate patterns present.

# 4. Displaying the Statistics

The describe function in pandas shows the basic statistics e.g means, standard deviations, medians, etc.

# 5. Data Visualisation

Below I have included visualisations of the data to better understand the differences and correlations between the variables measured:

**Scatterplots**

# 6. Correlations

Using the Pandas correlation function, we may be able to discern a distinction between the variables measured.

A good way to visualise this information is through a heatmap:
